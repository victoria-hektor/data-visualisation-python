# Data Visualisation and Analysis with Python in Google Colab

## Overview
This tutorial covers the **various ways to visualise data** in Python, with a focus on creating **effective and visually appealing plots**. We explore multiple libraries, custom styling, and interactive visualisations – all within Google Colab. 

Whether you’re working on personal projects or preparing for a professional environment, these skills will level up your data presentation game. 

⚠️ **Note**: Many companies prefer tools like **PowerBI** for data analysis. Stay tuned for a future tutorial covering its free version!
